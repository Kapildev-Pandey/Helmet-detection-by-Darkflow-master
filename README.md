# Helmet-detection-by-Darkflow-master

This program is based on Helmet_detection using darkflow master. For details check on [darkflow-master](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow) and download it and extract it. Remember the location as well it is important.

Here we will provide necessary path to to fill the gap. We also need configuration file and it's weights you can download from following link.

Requirements:

1.[darkflow-master](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow) 

2.[yolov2-tiny.cfg](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cEvqlN_OGS4AR_Vxu6AFoTHaBy294aJJ/view)

3.[yolov2-tiny_3000.weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oH9f94nYlnkT15amplhPv9uOTWZjamIS/view) 

4.Numpy, OpenCV etc.

**Note**: Your downloaded files location is important and note down it's path.

There are dataset is publicly availble and you can download from github. These dataset is large in size and you need more computation power with good intel prcocessor and high GB RAM. So you can use some pretrained model namely 'darkflow master'.

Even though we can work on our own dataset by taking some images of helmet and by using keras we can do data augmentations. You can also found similar work done by other programmers.

` python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace- `
